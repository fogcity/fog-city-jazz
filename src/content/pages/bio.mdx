It was while living in Florida as a teenager that he was exposed to the music of John Coltrane and being entranced by the playing of McCoy Tyner made the decision to make music his profession.

After brief studies in composition at the university of South Florida and a correspondence course from the Berkelee school of Music, Jeffrey moved to San Francisco where he found home and community. He studied piano with Art Lande and Mark Levine and spent two years in Los Angeles studing composition and arranging. at the Grove School of Music.

He has composed music for Film, Television, Circus, Theater, Dance and for Fun for the past four decades.
