I am available to help you learn all you wish know. Whether you want to work on technique, reading, improvisation or composition, I have been teaching students of of all ages and levels for nearly 40 years. I offer private lessons in piano, music theory and composition at my home, at your home, or through video chat applications such as FaceTime or Skype. I am also professional pianist and composer. I am fluent in most every style of music.

Feel free to contact me to chat. Letâ€™s see if this might be a good match!
